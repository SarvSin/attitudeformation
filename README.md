# Influencing the public psyche

Encouragement or discouragement of public behaviours is key in both public and private
spheres of economic activity, as well as in the functioning of a law-abiding, flourishing
society. This can only be achieved through effective persuasion tactics, and influencing
attitudes of the public – because behaviours usually reflect entrenched attitudes.
Attitudes form the lens through which we interpret and encode the objective things that we
encounter, subjectively. Indeed, knowledge of the function of attitude at play in a context
amplifies the effectiveness of an appeal to change. 

Potent among these is the appraisal function of attitude, which assists individuals in forming an opinion swiftly and easily. When
it comes to weighty, yet complex and relatively abstract topics like immigration, it is the
appraisal function of attitudes that is dominant. Decades of social psychology research has
brought forth a traditional model for assessing attitudes – the “multicomponent” model.
According to this, attitudes are shaped by affective, cognitive, and behavioural information.
Affective information encompasses impressions or feelings linked to an object, cognitive
information includes the convictions, and beliefs associated with an object, and behavioural
information accounts for past encounters with an object.

Much research has been conducted on the links between negative or positive attitudes
towards immigration, and socio-economic trends on both macro- and micro-levels. However,
this analysis focuses on exploring specific psychological influences of attitude-formation
within the context of immigration. How do affective, cognitive, and behavioural information
compare in their influence on attitude-formation towards immigration? Are they significant,
and does their relationship with attitude differ across cultures separated by geographical
borders?

Data analysed for this report was obtained from the latest round of The European Social
Survey. The ESS is a unique value-based, inter-national survey designed to facilitate an
understanding of attitudes and behaviour in the European region.

To assess the fit of a traditional socio-psychological theory to a modern survey dataset, and to
answer the question of whether differences in attitude-forming influences are significant
across countries, the following tasks will be performed - 

1. The dataset and its 
documentation will be numerically explored to deduce coding criteria for responses, and nonresponses.
2. It will be wrangled for graphical and numerical analyses. The large
dataset will need to be subset, reverse scoring will be applied, disparate coding for nonresponses in each variable of interest will be uniformly replaced with “NA” for analysis of
missing data. A deep analysis of missing data will be conducted. 
3. Thirdly, a multinomial,
ordered logistic regression analysis will be conducted to account for the ordered, categorical nature
of measurements. 
4. To test significance of predictors, differences across clusters, and
compare model fits, hypothesis tests will be conducted. Differences in deviance between
models will be tested against a null hypothesis of no change on a chi-squared distribution.
5. Hierarchical modelling will be justified in response to intermediate results obtained
during analysis, and performed to account for the effects of clustering and stratification in
data.
